		<h1>Hi, nice to meet you!</h1>
		<p>I am an aspiring software engineer and college student at Missouri University of 
			Science and Technology (or Missouri S&T if you prefer less syllables). My hobbies include learning new things,
			sports, and photography. I graduated from a small school in a little town called Clinton and started
			college at Missouri State University where I began a degree in cell and molecular biology. I soon found
			that I'd rather not attend school for the next ten years and discovered a passion for coding (I told you
			I like to learn new things). I then tried my hand at transferring to S&T where they accepted me. I'm
			a senior who will be graduating December 2024 with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I hope being a
			computer scientist brings a lot of joy to my life and family.
		</p>

			I've been learning computer science since the Fall of 2021. I've practiced using quite a few coding 
			languages. A couple of them are Python, Java, and C++. If I could choose what I would like to learn
			more about, it'd have to be cybersecurity and/or artificial intelligence. I'm currently in the
			Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Artificial Intelligence at my university and really enjoy it.
			Also, believe it or not, this is my first website that I have created! My school doesn't teach web
			development so I thought I'd teach myself! Any critiques are welcomed! Thanks for joining me on my
			adventures!
